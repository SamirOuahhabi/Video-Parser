## Description ##
Video Parser is a fun little personal project I started few years ago. This Java program grabs a list of the music videos hosted by [80smusicvids](http://www.80smusicvids.com) and [90smusicvidz](http://www.90smusicvidz.com) and allows the user to select videos from the list and generate a playlist that can played locally on the user's computer.

## TO-DO list ##
* Implement a search functionality.
* Use a database to store the videos.
* Create a user interface to manage playlists.
